## 📋 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. **Database Setup**
Connect to your Supabase database and run migrations in this order:

\i supabase/schema.sql
\i supabase/create-missing-tables.sql
\i supabase/parent-features-schema.sql
\i supabase/teacher-classroom-schema.sql
```

Or run the complete migration:
```sql
\i supabase/full-migration.sql
```

### 3. **Environment Variables**
Ensure `.env` file contains:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. **Run Tests**
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage # Check coverage
```
