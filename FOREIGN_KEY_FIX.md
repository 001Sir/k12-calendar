# Foreign Key Relationship Fix

## Problem
The app was trying to use foreign key relationships that Supabase couldn't find:
- `profiles!created_by` in events queries
- `profiles!event_attendees_user_id_fkey` in attendee queries

## Solution Applied
Instead of using Supabase's foreign key syntax, we now:
1. Fetch the main data first
2. Collect all user IDs that need names
3. Make a separate query to fetch all profile names
4. Map the names back to the records

## Files Updated
1. `/src/pages/events/EventDetails.jsx` - Fixed event creator lookup
2. `/src/hooks/useActivities.js` - Fixed all profile lookups for:
   - Event creators
   - RSVP users
   - Volunteers

## How It Works Now

### Before (causing errors):
```javascript
.select(`
  *,
  creator:profiles!created_by(full_name)
`)
```

### After (working):
```javascript
// 1. Fetch events without creator
.select('*, created_by')

// 2. Fetch creator names separately
const { data: profiles } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('user_id, full_name')
  .in('user_id', creatorIds)
```

## Result
✅ EventDetails page now loads without errors
✅ Activities feed shows proper user names
✅ All dashboards work with real data

## Note
This approach adds extra queries but ensures compatibility regardless of how your Supabase foreign keys are configured.
